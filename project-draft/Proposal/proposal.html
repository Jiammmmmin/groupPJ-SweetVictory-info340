            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p> 
                According to a study by <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/diabetes-emotional-mental-health#1"> WebMD </a>, people with diabetes are twice as likely to suffer from depression and are at an 
                increased risk for suicide. This highlights the importance of addressing the mental health needs of individuals with diabetes. An online communication 
                platform for diabetes patients can play a vital role in helping individuals adjust their mentality and improve their mental health. The platform can provide a safe and supportive 
                space where individuals can share their experiences, connect with others who understand their struggles, and access resources and information to help them manage the 
                emotional and psychological aspects of living with diabetes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing forums focus on recipes and daily routines such as <a href="https://diabetes.org/?s_src=AAP181101LXXXXM001CC%E2%80%9D&msclkid=2a3e73bcd34513aab0fb1070bb6de0d7">American Diabetes Association</a>, but don't have much to do with patients' mental health. Because of the real name system of the 
                forum, people are shy to share their inner emotions. A lack of ways to share their emotions might lead to mental health issues further down the line.

            </p>
            <p>
                We want to provide a unique platform for people with diabetes to share their experience of battling illness. They can also help each other out when they are 
                depressed. When people know they are not by themselves, they gain more courage to overcome their difficulties.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                Since our wesbite focuses on building a community for diabetes patients, our targeted users are people who have diabetes and people who think that they might have the disease. With the website, 
                the patient or potential patients, as a group, can discuss about the different complications, ways of mental comfort. The platform allows our users to make and edit posts to 
                seek for help or find patients with the similar complications. The posts would be upload to a public community page. Importantly, all the posts would be anonymous to ensure all users' privacy. The users would also be able to make comments on others' posts to 
                provide help or maybe just start a chat. The website would also include a personal information page to keep track of the user's own posts to see replies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the platform, all diabetes patients and any potential patients can find experience of others and exchange their thoughts with each other. With the website, users can get to know people who suffer from the same disease regardless of age, gender, region, race, or social role. 
                Being able to help and meet the needs of our users is the basis and necessity for the existence of our platform, and we will try our best to achieve it!
